# THESE ARE COMPUTATIONAL-MODELLING PROJECTS FOR COURSE MOD-510 at Universitetet i Stavanger.
Problem statements are shared in pdf folder in each project folder as pdf files.

### Project 1 - The tip of the iceberg
Learning objectives of this project are:<br>
• Get experience with structuring and writing a report.<br>
• Be introduced to useful Python libraries for scientific computing.<br>
• Explore numerical round-off and truncation errors.<br>
• Understand basic concepts of isostasy, and apply an existing Python package to study ice melting in the Antarctic.<br>

### Project 2 - Transport in Porous Media - From Laboratory Scale to Field Scale <br>
Learning objectives of this project are:<br>
• Learn to use matrix equation to do linear regression, and estimate model parameters from experimental data <br>
• Solve the diffusivity equation using an implicit solution method<br>
• Compare sparse matrix solvers with standard dense solvers<br>
• Estimate reservoir properties, such as reservoir permeability, and reservoir volume using a model for the well pressure and data from a well test<br>

### Project 3 - Zombies and Covid-19 - Trust the models, or your gut?<br>
Learning objectives of this project are:<br>
• Implement a solver for systems of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in Python.<br>
• Learn how to escape a zombie invasion using wisdom from simple compartment models.<br>
• Describe the spread of the Corona virus with a compartment model.<br>
• Constrain model input parameters by comparing with data.<br>

### Project 4 - Gone (randomly?) viral<br>
Learning objectives of this project are:<br>
• Model disease transmission mechanistically as a random walk on a 2D lattice grid.<br>
• Run many simulations, and quantify model uncertainty by computing sample means and standard deviations of the results.<br>
• Visualize model uncertainty.<br>
• Investigate how model parameters in the random walk approach can be related to those in a continuous compartment model.<br>
• Explore your own scenario for the spread of Covid-19 (Corona virus).<br>
